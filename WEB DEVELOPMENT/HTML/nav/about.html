        <h2>REASON BEHIND THE CREATION</h2>
        <p>First of all I am a fan of  the k-pop music.K-pop is short for Korean pop music, whether the music is 
          part of Korea’s vast industrial entertainment complex, indie music, or anything in between.
          group but my fav group out of all of them are BTS.
          The rise of idol groups, in particular, was a crucial step toward building modern K-Pop. 
          Idol groups are built by Korean music studios, and consist of girl groups and boy groups — 
          usually between four and nine members, though some groups can be even larger. Most groups 
          have vocalists as well as rappers, and most non-ballad singles contain at least one rap 
          break. Songs are usually engineered in studios and often feature seamless vocals and irrepressible earworm hooks, 
          while K-pop idol group videos feature dazzling visuals and eye-catching video concepts.
          The third generation of K-pop kicked off shortly thereafter, around 2013. 
          The ongoing mainstreaming and globalization of K-pop is now led by hitmakers like BTS, 
          Blackpink, Red Velvet, Twice, and Exo. These bands and others have all worked with a 
          greater fusion of musical genres and styles beyond the usual “pop song with rap break” 
          formula. It’s not unusual these days to see third-gen groups do world tours with US legs, 
          and BTS alone has pushed many boundaries in its pursuit of mainstream US success, like its
          performances on Saturday Night Live, at Grand Central Station, and New Year’s Eve in Times 
          Square.this is the history behind the k-pop industry.And as you can see
          BTS has been a huge influence in the k-pop music industry and hence the reason behind choosing
          them.I hope u will enjoy reading my contents.
