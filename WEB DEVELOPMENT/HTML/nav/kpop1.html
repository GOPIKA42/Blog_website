                <p>BTS songs have deep and meaningful lyrics which every person can relate to in their lives but the song that effectively brought about a significant change was their first English single “Dynamite” that went on to become a major milestone of their career in many ways. This song was released on 21st August 2020 when the world was put on hold due to the pandemic, and people all over the world were in severe distress. This song had an enormous influence on the audience as it was meant to cheer up, give some relaxation, and uplift the mood of the ARMY (BTS fanbase) and the people in general who were going through a lot of stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 situation. The choice to release the song in English was so that the message could reach globally to their global audience.
                    <br><br>
                    Little did BTS know that their song would hit all the right places and face massive success. Dynamite was the first music video in Youtube history to hit more than 100M views in just 24 hours, which is just one of the many records this song alone created and shattered likewise. According to Forbes, Dynamite also had the biggest YouTube premiere of all time with the live view count being between 3 and 4 million. It debuted at no. 1 on Spotify’s Daily Global Top 50 Chart beating Taylor Swift’s previous record of the song Cardigan thus holding the title for the “Biggest Spotify Debut of 2020” and ultimately had a breakthrough at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, the first of their many songs that went on to achieve this feat after Dynamite.

                    BTS Dynamite has now led both Billboard lists for four total weeks, the longest double domination. The track also brought a Grammy nomination to BTS for the category “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance”, thus making BTS the first Korean group to reach the stage of Grammys. Dynamite broke uncountable records which practically cannot be enlisted in just one article. Therefore, Dynamite was a major commercial and artistic success for BTS and it rightfully proved that the Global impact of this powerhouse of talent group is HUGE!

                    Say this for “Dynamite”: It’s catchy as all get-out. Its Western crossover is also one that the self-assured members of BTS—known to their fans by the mononyms J-Hope, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, RM, Suga, and V—eagerly sought out. No one appears to have forced their hand in recording an English-language hit. This despite the fact that, as recently as last year, they were attesting to their disinterest in recording in English just to score a U.S. chart-topper. “We don’t want to change our identity or our genuineness to get the number one,” group leader RM (aka Rap Monster, their most fluent English speaker) told Entertainment Weekly in early 2019.

                        “Like, if we sing suddenly in full English, and change all these other things, then that’s not BTS.”
