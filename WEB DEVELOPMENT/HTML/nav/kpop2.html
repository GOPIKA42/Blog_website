                    It added, "1. Rainy Days-In this track, V’s voice melds beautifully with the sound of rain and everyday white noises, tugging at the listeners’ heartstrings. 2. Blue-An homage to old-school R&B with a modern twist, adding a special flair to the song. 3. Love Me Again- A light and captivating R&B track with an alluring vibe that lingers long. V’s signature baritone shines through in this track. 4. Slow Dancing-The focus track of this album, a ‘70s romantic soul style track that exudes a laid-back and free-spirited feeling, just as the title suggests."
