                <img src="SUGA-agust-D-tour.webp">
                <p>In a sweet surprise for fans, BTS member Suga has announced his first-ever solo tour
                    <br><br>
                    The tour will then take Min Yoon-gi, known professionally across the world by his stage names Suga and Agust D, to Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Seoul and Japan. Suga will also be playing in New Jersey, Illinois, and California before wrapping up his US tour in Oakland on May 16 and 17.
                    <br><br>
                    While India is yet not on the tour list of Suga, the dates for his gigs in Asia are yet to be announced, so there may still be some hope for Indian ARMY, the fans of BTS.
                    <br><br>
                    This will be the first concert by Suga as a soloist, with his last concert as a BTS member being the one held in October in Busan to support the southeastern city's bid to host the 2030 World Expo. The tour does not yet have an official name.
                    <br><br>
                    BTS, which consists of Jin, RM, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook including Suga, announced last year that they would be taking a sabbatical to focus on their individual professions while underlining that this would not be a permanent arrangement. They've certainly delivered on their promise, as the band continues to push group content, such as the upcoming series, while still pursuing lucrative solo pursuits
                   <br><br>
                   The K-pop group is also subject to mandatory military duty in South Korea, which is slated to last until 2025.
